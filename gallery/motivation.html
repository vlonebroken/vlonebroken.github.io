    <p>The gallery, like any other, is a mere showcase of the authors' mental status quo represented in imagery form. A simulation, as he thinks, of the process of time.</p>
    <p>Memento mori.</p>
    <p>The archive will remain available for those who ponder nostalgically over what has passed and/or to keep track of previous mind states and of the evolution behind the gallery.</p>
    <p>Further gallery entries will be appended to the archive. </p>    
    <p>A Codex Modernus, of sorts.</p>
